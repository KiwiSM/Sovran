With the ability to lift into orbit nearly 64 metric tons. It is composed of three Falcon 9 nine-engine cores whose 27 Merlin engines together generate more than 5 million pounds of thrust at liftoff, equal to approximately eighteen 747 aircraft. Why fly eighteen times on a 747 aircraft when you can fly once in one of our Falcon Heavies? Book your ticket now, and have seat."

Just as God seeded earth with mankind we will deliver mankind to our galactic neighbouring planets and seed those with the American dream."
